    Yooooooo, here I come again!!
    I’m writing this at an age where people are still learning what love truly is.
    What you gave me was never confusing or loud, it was steady.
  </p>

  <p>
    You respected my space, my thoughts, and the person I was becoming.
    You made me feel valued not through grand gestures, but through
    consistency, honesty, and care that showed up even on ordinary days.
  </p>

  <p>
    With you, love felt safe. I was never rushed, never diminished,
    never made to feel small. You listened not just to my words,
    but to the pauses between them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Knowing that our relationship is quite complicated from others,,
    I just want to say thank you for choosing to be with me every single time.
    And And honestly Being with you never feels heavy, it feels natural. 
    There’s an ease in us that doesn’t need constant words or explanations. Even in silence, 
    I feel close to you. It's basically i feel like home.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a strong, undeniable pull between us,one that doesn’t need explanation.
    Our chemistry is natural and intense, and the closeness we share feels instinctive. 
    We crave each other in a way that goes beyond words in presence, in touch, 
    in the quiet need to be near. 
    What we have is passionate, mutual, and deeply real and something that lives between us without 
    needing to be spoken aloud. And that's what makes our relation special and alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Last but not the least , Thank you for everything. I LOVE YOU BAVA❤️ YOU ARE ALWAYS THE BEST BAVA❤️.
